# Image-Manipulation-Using-OpenCV
I have written a program to perform simple image manipulation using openCV and python. This program loads an image by either reading it from a file or capturing it directly from a camera. When the user presses a key, it performs the operation corresponding to the key on the original image (not the result of the last processing step).
